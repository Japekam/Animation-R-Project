```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE)
library(magick)
```

```{css}
body {
  font-size: 16px; /* Changing the default font size */
}
p {
  color: #FF0000; /* Changing the text color to red */
}
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-weight: bold; /* Making headings bold */
}
```

## Project requirements

I started this project by signing up for Github account under the name of Japekam. After completing the basic setup, I created a repository called stats 220. Along that I also made a README file in the same repository.

To be aligned with the project requirements, I used 2 different types of headings i.e level 1 and 2. I created several bullet points (both ordered and unordered). I also changed some text to bold, italics, a different color and added up a couple of emojis in it. I also added up a link to my Linkedin.

The link for my github repo is as follows:

## My meme

![](inspo_meme.png)

I saw the inspo meme and based on the same topic, I used similar situation to form my meme. I re-scaled both my downloaded images in-order to align with the text on the right hand side. Apart from that, for the text images, I changed the size, colour and background color.

```{r meme-code, eval=TRUE}

# static meme

crowded_train <- image_read("crowded_metro.png") %>% #https://images.pexels.com/photos/2706436/pexels-photo-2706436.jpeg
  image_scale(530)

empty_train <- image_read("empty_metro.png") %>% #https://images.pexels.com/photos/302428/pexels-photo-302428.jpeg
  image_scale(530)

# Creating blank boxes to write text on them

text1 <- image_blank(width = 350, height = 350, color = "#00f0FF") %>%
  image_annotate(text = "Books in\nSchool Bag", color = "#000000", size = 60)

text2 <- image_blank(width = 350, height = 350, color = "#00f0FF") %>%
  image_annotate(text = "Books in\nCollege Bag", color = "#000000", size = 60)

# creating various rows and appending the corresponding image to it's text

first_row <- c(crowded_train, text1) %>%
  image_append()

second_row <- c(empty_train, text2) %>%
  image_append()

# appending the final meme together

final_meme <- c(first_row, second_row) %>%
  image_append(stack = TRUE)

final_meme
```


```{r animation-code, eval=FALSE}

# animation

old_pic <- image_scale(image_read("crowded_metro.png"))

new_pic <- image_scale(image_read("empty_metro.png"))

# animating the meme by using all 4 images together and resizing it

final_animation <- image_resize(c(text1, old_pic, text2, new_pic), '300x250!') %>%
  image_background('white') %>% # defining the background color
  image_morph() %>% # the fading effect
  image_animate(optimize = TRUE, fps = 5) # defining the speed of effect

# saving it on my computer

image_write(final_animation, "my_animation.gif")

```

## Creativity

I creatively made a meme taking a referencing from personal experience! I used to carry so many books in our bag as a young bud, whereas now the things have changed completely and I find it quite funny. I travel using Public transport everyday and got this idea while I was in the train. So, I found an inspiration meme which perfectly objectified my imagination.  Hence, I have been able to demonstrate creativity by making a meme centered around my experience. Hopefully it would also be relatable to most of the STATS 220 Students! :-)

## Learning reflection

In Module 1, I learnt about the importance of using Github. I did not have an account earlier. In the processing of making the account, I came across couple of cool projects by senior data scienctists which inspired me to continue to keep working on my GitHub profile,. Learning cool things of R, especially using images/gif never goes wrong. I would love to learn more about other aspects of R later. I love to work with data in form of numbers/excel sheet. I am looking forward to learn more cool stuff using R(and SQL/Python)!!
